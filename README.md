Inspiration
The inspiration for Trail Less Traveled came from the current stay at home order due to COVID-19 pandemic.
Coloradans are known for their love of the outdoors and active life style.
The stay at home order is driving everyone to hit the trail or a park to escape Cabin Fever.
It created a huge challenge to get fresh air and exercise on a hiking trail without running into a crowd.
We created an app that tracks real time traffic data on the trails so our users can choose trails of their preference that has low traffic.
